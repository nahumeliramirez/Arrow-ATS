Version 5.4
**************************************************
Auther: Ameen Nihad
Release date: 17 FEB 2017

- Bug: Board renders incorrectly if mirror option is checked before drag/drop new board file.
  fixed by rendering board dimensions first becasue mirror feature currently rely on dimension boundries.
- Bug: If a layer has no signals it will not be populated in (Board Layer) drop down list, even if layer has elements.
  Example of that is Adafruit PCB Reference Ruler.brd which has no signals on top layer.
  fixed by looping through elements and check if they are on Top or Bottom layer based on mirror value.
- All via Shapes are now supported, previously all vias were assumed to be round.
- Pad "Offset" shape is now supported, previously it was rendered as round pad.
- Resting paramenters are now used to caclulate vias & pads diameters, previously vias were caclculates using default hadrcoded values, and pads were assumed to be twice the drill size.
- Support layer 46-Milling.
- Support for open paths in board dimensions.
- Support for multiple tools to mill board dimansions, tool size is linked to wire width.
- Curved board dimensions are rendered as G2/G3 commands.
- Tabs functionality is fully impelmented.
- Gcode tab is seperated to multiple tabs (Taces, Drilling, Milling, Tabs & Gocde).
- Circles as board dimensions are now supported.
- Bug: Pads not connected to signals were considered as same signal, therefore adjacent pads will be merged if inflate value is high enough.
  Fixed by assigning pad name to pad signal name.
- Top/Bottom layers are always listed in Board Layer dropdown list.
- Blank FR4 diemension and Registration Holes features are fully implemented, useful for milling boards with multiple layers.

Version 5.3
**************************************************
Auther: Ameen Nihad
Release date: 19 JAN 2017

New features:
- Support for Curves in boarder dimension and signal wires is added, in V5.2 this feature was limited to board dimension only and to +/-90 degrees.
- Support for slots and inner dimensions is added.
- Support for Panelizing is added, multiple boards or multiple copies of same board can be placed in single .brd file then imported to the widget.
- A new feature added to avoid tracing board dimensions, this will eliminate job time.
- A new feature added to correct paths orientation, to give the user a choice to do conventional or climb milling.
- Curves resolution can now be adjusted by the user for the UI (Under Render tab).
- Tab settings added to UI (under Gcode tab), implementation to be done in Version 5.4

Enhancements
- Optimized how board boundaries are calculated.
- Optimized draw3dDimension function - use clipDimensions not wires.
- Render button changed to refresh all board data, this is important for new added features.
- Gcode comments with M6 (Tool change) - Issue #17.
- Function draw3dSignalPoly updated to support curved polygons.
- Removed auto refresh form Mirror settings, refresh to be done manually by user by hitting Render button.

Bus fixed:
- Fixed a bug in curves with angle > 180
- Fixed a bug in dimension milling which caused a gap between plunge and retract positions.
- Fixed a bug in drill holes, vias holes were not mirrored correctly.
- Fixed a bug in position of dimensions within an element, previously dimensions were taken from packages without considering element location.


Version 5.2 Quick Fix
**************************************************
Auther: Ameen Nihad
Release date: 19 JAN 2017

In exportGcodeMillHoles function, G0 is used by mistake to plunge the cutting tool, G0 changed to G1.
Update stamp: V5.2QUICKFIX

Versoin 5.2
**************************************************
Auther: Ameen Nihad
Release date: 05 JAN 2017

- Changed how holes are handled, now holes for Pads, Vias, packages and Plains are treated exactly the same.
- Now holes are either drilled or milled, that depending on diameter of tools used, i.e. values of:
    - Maximum hole diameter to drill
    - Diameter of tool for cutting dimension
- Fix the bug of "Board dimensions rendered incorrectly", Eagle don't care about order of wires and previous code assumes they are in right order,
  bug fixed by sorting the wires and correct their direction.
- Support for Curves in board dimensions is added.

Update stamp: V5.2D20170105 (this can be used to locate the updated/added code)

Versoin 5.1
**************************************************
Auther: Ameen Nihad
Release date: 29 DEC 2016

- Fix a bug in rendering Vias
Bug: Previous code uses Via Drill Size to render the via, which causes vias to render smaller than actual size.
Solution: Calulate Via diameter and use it for rendering.
Update stamp: V5.1D20161227 (this can be used to locate the updated/added code)
Note: When via Diameter is set to auto in Eagle, the Diameter is removed from the .brd file, so we need to calculate it from Drill size.

- Implement board mirror feature
Update stamp: V5.1D20161229 (this can be used to locate the updated/added code)
